  Here we have two projects: 
  - [Debug Contract] gives a basic understanding of built in debugger for stepping through your code. So when something goes wrong, you can find out exactly what it was, and fix it promptly.
  - [Variable Inspection] provides the ability to perform variable inspection on your contracts. 

So, let's learn more about Truffle Solidity Debugger while working with these projects.
